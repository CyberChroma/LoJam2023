Working with the TrendFeed

TrendFeed
- The TrendFeed singleton exists within LiveFeedPanel in the LiveFeed Canvas object
- The TrendFeed will randomly select objects to go trending.
- The TrendFeed has settings for how long objects can be trending.
- The TrendFeed has settings for the max number of trending objects.

- The TrendFeed spawns "Short TrendCards" and "Long TrendCards"
- These are purely based on how long the objects are trending
- There are four settings to control the times that dictate which type of card will spawn
Ex. A trend time of 10s would generate a short card, where 20s generates a long card

- The TrendFeed has four public functions for querying the TrendFeed
- The TrendFeed starts populating trends as soon as it is active. (This can be changed in the future)
- The TrendFeed must be manually stopped. It will clear everything by the end of the next update.

CollectableObjectInfo - ScriptableObjects
- These objects are used to identify the GameObjects collected by a UFO.
- These can be created through the Asset > Create menu

CollectableObjectList - ScriptableObject
- This is a singleton object per scene to hold the list of CollectableObjectInfo objects.
- The TrendFeed singleton uses this to know what objects can go trending during gameplay.
- Ideally, all CollectableObjectInfo scriptable objects are added to its list.
- If there were multiple scenes / levels in the future, each scene can have its own CollectableObjectList object
